<h2>Numinix App</h2>

A Project built for Numinix for an interview of my skills.

This project is hosted on Netlify.
Link: https://numinix-project.netlify.app/

<h3>Description</h3>

This was made with an unsecure api. The project was launched on netlify using "https://randomuser.me/api/?results=10" as an api instead. Due to the new api missing some information, the project is missing a dynamic 'catchphrase', 'business', and 'business slogan'.

The netlify site is being launched from a build of a very similar app using the aforementioned different api. The link to that github repository is "https://github.com/Markphilbert/numinix2". This repository shows only the code for the app while the numinix2 repository is just a build only being used to run to netlify.

I included the use of vue router and created clickable links to the 'email', 'username', and 'website' for each 'customer'. I also implemented a small use of vue transitions for styling.
